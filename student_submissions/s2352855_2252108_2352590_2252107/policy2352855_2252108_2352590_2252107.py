    Brief Description of First-Fit-Decreasing: 
    First Fit Decreasing (FFD) Algorithm
    The First Fit Decreasing Algorithm places products into the first stock that can accommodate them, starting with the largest products (sorted in decreasing order by size).

    Steps:

    Sort products by size in descending order (considering either width, height, or area).
    For each product, iterate through stocks to find the first one where it fits.
    Place the product in that stock.
    If rotation is allowed, try both orientations.
    Advantages: Simple and quick to implement with decent results.

    Disadvantages: Can leave more trim loss compared to Best Fit as it doesnâ€™t optimize for space utilization.

    Average trim-loss (300) : 0.2076

    The Column Generation Algorithm is an optimization technique used primarily in solving large-scale linear programming problems, such as cutting stock or bin-packing
    Solves a master problem to optimize the current set of columns.
    Generates new columns by solving a subproblem that identifies potential improvements.
    Adds the new columns to the master problem and repeats until no further improvements can be made.
    This approach is efficient because it avoids enumerating all possibilities, focusing only on relevant patterns that improve the solution. It is widely used in logistics, scheduling, and manufacturing for minimizing waste or cost.
